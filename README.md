### Hi there 👋

**AniswagMC/AniswagMC** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently teaching myself Neural Nets and am hoping to eventually make a project with them
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Personal Projects
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with growing myself as a sofware engineer
- 💬 Ask me about Golf, Volleyball and Cricket
- 📫 How to reach me: email: anirudh.duggal.ad.ad@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- Alright, time for a quick game, two truths and a lie:  
 ❓ I've broken a bone 🦴 by falling off a stationary bicycle 🚲  
 ❓ I've been in a team of three where I did all the work 😫  
 ❓ I absolute despise 🤮 dark chocolate 🍫
